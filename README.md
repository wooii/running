## Running Pace Analysis and Prediction
1. Pace is linearly related to `log2(Distance)`.
2. Two distinct phases: 200m to 1500m and 1500m to 42195m (marathon).
3. Each phase follows its own linear formula: `Pace = a * log2(Distance) + b`.
4. Use this model to predict or evaluate your personal best for various distances.
